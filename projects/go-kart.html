      <h2 class="sec">Project Overview</h2>

      <p>This project began with two big goals:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Build something exciting and challenging from scratch.</li>
        <li>Gain hands-on engineering experience in CAD design, fabrication, and mechanical system integration.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We originally debated building a shifter kart, but quickly realized that would push us beyond scope—those machines can hit 0–60 mph in ~4 seconds and require precision tolerances and safety features far above what made sense for a first build. Instead, we pivoted to a non-shifter, single-seater, four-stroke kart: still capable of ~60 mph, but realistic to design and fabricate safely on our own.</p>

      <p>At the very beginning, we set a budget cap and created a Bill of Materials (BOM) draft. This helped us estimate costs, decide which parts could be fabricated in-house, and which would need to be purchased outright. The BOM became a living document, updated weekly as we refined the design and sourced components.</p>

      <h2 class="sec">Subsystems</h2>

      <h3>Engine &amp; Drivetrain</h3>
      <p>Engine selection was one of the first and most critical decisions. We considered the Predator 212cc, a proven 6.5 HP engine known for affordability and reliability, but it only came with pull-start. Converting it to electric start would have required new components (ring-gear flywheel, starter motor, battery, crankshaft machining) and added cost and risk.</p>

      <p>We instead chose the Lifan 212cc Electric Start (ES)—a Honda GX200 clone with nearly identical performance but a built-in electric starter and pull-start backup. It shares the same shaft and bolt pattern as the Predator, making it fully compatible with our Comet TAV2 torque converter. This choice fit our philosophy: simple, reliable, and beginner-friendly, while still leaving room for future Arduino-based upgrades.</p>

      <p>The drivetrain was designed around a live rear axle, with keyed hubs, sprocket, rotor, and lock collars held in place by flangettes and set screws. This rugged and straightforward setup is common in karts, offering low maintenance and strong performance.</p>

      <h3>Chassis — Design</h3>
      <p>Our original CAD design used circular DOM/ERW tubing. It looked clean and mirrored professional kart frames, but round tubing required expensive precision bending we couldn’t do in-house. Flat components like the engine plate and pedal mounts also wouldn’t weld as cleanly to curved surfaces.</p>

      <p>To stay under budget and fully in-house, we redesigned the chassis with 1.0" × 1.0" × 0.120" A513 square tubing. Square tubing allowed easy cutting, welding, and jigging using standard shop tools while still offering more than enough strength. The trade-off was a slightly heavier frame, but for our build, the advantages outweighed that drawback.</p>

      <p>The chassis was modeled in SolidWorks Weldments, fitted carefully around the engine, torque converter, axle, seat, and pedals. Spindle tabs and the brake mount were also CAD-modeled for cutting and welding. Preliminary static simulations confirmed that key members—steering crossbar, seat supports, and front rails—could handle a conservative 180 lb driver load without unacceptable deflection.</p>

      <h3>Chassis — Manufacture</h3>
      <p>We ordered 60 ft of square tubing, cut each piece according to the SolidWorks cut list, and deburred every joint for flush welds.</p>

      <p>Chop saw: handled both straight and angled cuts.</p>

      <p>Angle grinder: smoothed burrs and cleaned edges so welds could penetrate fully.</p>

      <p>We tack-welded subframes first, checking squareness by measuring diagonals and using clamps and magnets. MIG welding was then applied in alternating sequences to control heat distortion. Welds were ground flush only where plates or brackets needed to mount.</p>

      <p>For the axle hangers, we clamped a dummy axle in place during welding. This ensured the real axle would be level and aligned with the chainline. The engine plate was slotted to allow chain tensioning in final assembly.</p>

      <h3>Steering</h3>
      <p>For steering, we used a vintage go-kart steering kit as the base, then customized it with additional bearings to improve smoothness and reduce play. The wheel was mounted to a shaft carried by a U-bend front crossbar, welded directly into the chassis. This gave us solid ergonomics, smoother operation, and alignment directly with the spindles for proper geometry.</p>

      <h3>Braking</h3>
      <p>The kart uses a rear hydraulic disc brake system, chosen over mechanical for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Higher clamping force and consistent feel at speed.</li>
        <li>Fade resistance under repeated braking.</li>
        <li>Simpler pedal feel and easier service.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The rotor mounts directly to the live axle, with a hydraulic caliper fixed to a chassis bracket. A pedal-mounted master cylinder connects through a clevis linkage. This setup gave reliable stopping power and added confidence to the kart’s performance.</p>

      <h3>Electrical System</h3>
      <p>Although the Lifan engine had a factory key-start, we engineered a custom push-to-start system. Using a 12V battery, relay, fuses, and a momentary button, we built a safe parallel circuit that worked alongside the original key. This modernized the kart’s controls while reinforcing good electrical design practices.</p>

      <h2 class="sec">Week-by-Week Timeline (15 Weeks)</h2>
      <p>Weeks 1–2: Defined scope, set budget cap, drafted BOM.</p>
      <p>Weeks 3–4: Engine research and selection (Predator vs Lifan).</p>
      <p>Weeks 5–6: Early CAD in circular tubing; confirmed packaging.</p>
      <p>Weeks 7–8: Switched to square tubing; redesigned chassis in SolidWorks.</p>
      <p>Weeks 9–10: Ran structural checks; finalized steering geometry with vintage kit + bearings.</p>
      <p>Weeks 11–12: Ordered tubing and hardware; cut, deburred, and tack-welded chassis.</p>
      <p>Weeks 13–14: MIG welded frame; aligned axle hangers with dummy shaft; slotted engine plate.</p>
      <p>Week 15: Bench-tested engine (manual + electric start), integrated push-to-start, and mounted hydraulic brake system.</p>

      <h2 class="sec">Skills &amp; Outcomes</h2>
      <p>CAD &amp; Analysis: SolidWorks weldments, cut lists, preliminary structural simulation.</p>
      <p>Fabrication: Chop saw cutting, angle grinding/deburring, MIG welding, alignment and jigging.</p>
      <p>Mechanical Systems: Engine and torque converter integration, live axle setup, hydraulic brake system.</p>
      <p>Electrical Systems: Push-to-start integration with relay logic and fusing.</p>
      <p>Project Management: Budget/BOM tracking, procurement, and timeline execution.</p>
